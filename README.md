This is my little project for Pi Day (3 March) 2021.

I decided to try to calculate the digits of Pi by taking the area under a bell curve obtained with the height/weight of 25,000 human beings measured from the [Statistics Online Computational Resource](http://socr.ucla.edu/docs/resources/SOCR_Data/SOCR_Data_Dinov_020108_HeightsWeights.html).

[I wrote a post about it on my blog here!](https://tbat.ch/2021/03/16/calculating-pi-by-finding-the-area-under-a-bell-curve.html)
